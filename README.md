### resources

Data: samples.json

Software: visual studio code, javascript, D3 library, Plotly library, bootstrap 


### overview
the goal of this project was to create dashboard with javascript. The D3 library is used to allow user interface on the deployed html page. Plotly is used to create various charts. Samples.json contains information regarding belly button bacteria. The dashboard allows volunteers to identify what species of bacteria is found and what quantity is in their belly button. The bubble chart allows the viewer to see the relative frequency of all bacterial species in their belly button. The bar chart shows the top 10 most populous species found in their belly button. The gauge shows how often they wash their belly button. This project has been deployed to github pages.
